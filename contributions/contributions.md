# Contributing to an Open Source Project

<!--markdownlint-disable MD035-->

---

## Why

------

Instead of maintaining your own version, you can contribute to the project

Note:

* Maintaining a project is hard
* Takes time and resources
* Always new priorities
* Same as using OSS: leverage the mass of the community

------

Contributions that make it to the project get maintained by the community

Note:

* Everyone benefit from it
  * Others: new features
  * You: maintained updates

---

## What to contribute

* Source code
* Documentation
* Translation
* Issue and bug
* Security vulnerability
* Events

Note:

Events help build the community provide opportunity to learn
