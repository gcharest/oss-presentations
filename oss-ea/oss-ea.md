## Open Source Software

>Software available under an open source licence.

For the purpose of the Government of Canada, we consider the Open Source Initiative's [definition](https://opensource.org/docs/definition.php) the current standard.

--

## Basic Rights

1. Use the software as you wish
2. Study the source code
3. Modify the source code
4. Redistribute the software

--

## Conditions

1. Notice
2. Derived work's licence

Note:

Depends on type of licence (see below)

--

## It's not open source

If you only have access to the source code.

>You **must** have the rights based on an open source licence.

---

## Types of Open Source Licences

--

### Permissive

>Allows you to do pretty much what you want with it and distribute it under different conditions than you obtained it.

--

### Reciprocal (Copyleft)

>Allow you to do pretty much the same but require you to redistribute on the same conditions under which you obtained it.

[Excerpt from US Defense OSS FAQ](https://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/#Q:_Is_open_source_software_commercial_software.3F_Is_it_COTS.3F):
> Open source software that has at least one non-governmental use, and has been or is available to the public, is commercial software. If it is already available to the public and is used unchanged, it is usually COTS.

## Why bother

> It looks like a lot of work...

--

Technically, you manages thousands of licences already...

--

* Don't start with a blank canvas, focus on the added value
* Speed up development time by reusing existing solutions to common problems
* Leverage a large community of peers to enhance quality and for wider maintenance
* Build on top of giants' shoulders and communities

> Aspiring to world class is not enough, when everyone else starts there
