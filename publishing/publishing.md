## Why

------

Directive on Management of Information Technology

>C.2.3.8.3 If a custom-built application is the appropriate option, by default any source code written by the government must be released in an open format via Government of Canada websites and services designated by the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat

Directive on Management of Information Technology

>C.2.3.8.4 All source code must be released under an appropriate open source software license

------

* Encourages [best coding practices](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/21/why-we-code-in-the-open/)
* It aligns with our goal of being an open government by releasing [data and information of value to citizens](https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pol/doc-eng.aspx?id=28108#sec5.1).
* Find people with similar problems that could be interested in helping you ([ORE](https://github.com/canada-ca/ore-ero))
* Find new usage to your software ([AIA](https://github.com/canada-ca/aia-eia-js))

Note:

* UK Ministry of Justice found that the quality and readability of their code improved
* Government wants to be more transparent but also bring value to its work
* ORE found partners in cities across the country
* People found that the AIA could be leveraged for other assessments

## Hands-on

Let's start by creating a repository and uploading your project.

Note:

(On screen step-by-step demo using first project)

------

Add a licence of your choice.

Which did you pick and why?

---

## Crown Copyright

Technically, the work we do in the office is Crown Copyright, it belongs to Her Majesty in right of Canada.

------

## Licence

The licence you choose has to be applied by someone with the delegated authority from the Crown.

Typically an Assistant Deputy Minister or someone with the delegated authority.

## Compliance

Inbound vs Outbound
